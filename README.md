This is the main webpage of my website. It leads to a simple calculator, and various other things I created to learn and practice HTML.

This is a game I made completely from scratch. 
It is a recreation of the Python game, as the average would prefer an actual website/User Interface than to play in a Command Line.
It is being updated as frequent as I find errors in the game and if I desire to update/change the design.
