This is the first ever page I made on my website. It leads to a simple calculator, and various other things I created to learn and practice HTML. 

The current list of webpages is:

* Calculator
* Matchmaker
* Website Survey
* Image Page



# https://laoluadewoye.github.io/Money_Making_Game_VTwo/Main_Page/Game_index.html
This is a game I made completely from scratch. 
It is a recreation of the Python game, as the average would prefer an actual website/User Interface than to play in a Command Line.
It is being updated as frequent as I find errors in the game and if I desire to update/change the design.

I will update my website ever so often if I see anything I want to add or change. If you have any suggestions yourself, please email me at laoluadewoye@gmail.com. 

I know I put a Survey page but I then realized I did not know how to save the results to a database. As of right now (01/20/22) it is just for show while I decide how I want to go about the problem.
