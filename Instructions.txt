Hello There!

I don't have the money nor knowhow to manage a domain, 
So here is a zip folder you just opened!

All you should have to do for this to work properly,
is to unzip the folder, 
and click the html file named "index".

It SHOULD work with just those two steps.
If it doesn't, welp. 

Anyways, have fun!
-----------------------------------------------------------
If seeing this on GitHub:

You don't need to do anything above. 
Just look below the list of files and check out read me folder. 
It will have all the root links for each website I have created.
I have figured out how to get myself a public online domain, so now I have this website for the time being.
Enjoy!
