Hello There!

I don't have the money nor knowhow to manage a domain, 
So here is a zip folder you just opened!

All you should have to do for this to work properly,
is to unzip the folder, 
and click the html file named "index".

It SHOULD work with just those two steps.
If it doesn't, welp. 

Anyways, have fun!
