    <h1>Welcome to the Money Game!</h1>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <div class="pushright">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Click the button to begin. You start with a 1000 dollars in your hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          If not, you can customize what you want to start with in the next
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>On the game screen you will see six buttons.</li>
        <li>
          Each button, when pressed, brings up a menu where you can spend or
          move your money around.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can only look at one menu at a time, as you can only do one action
          per day.
        </li>
        <li>
          The aim is get as much money as you can in 365 days. Go big as much
          possible before the time is up or you stop the program!
        </li>
        <li>Only use integers to submit values for simplicity.</li>
        <li>
          If you ever need to access this page again, there will be a button in
          the top left corner in the game. However, DO NOT RESET THE GAME PAGE
          OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PROGRESS!
        </li>
      </ul>
