    <h1>Welcome to the Money Game!</h1>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <div class="pushright">
      <ul>
        <li>You start with a 1000 dollars in your hand.</li>
        <li>You can do a variety of actions. One action lets a day pass.</li>
        <li>
          To do an action, press the corresponding button. A menu for the button
          will appear.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can look at multiple menus at once, but once one of the menus is
          used it resets and updates to the next day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every seven days you get a weekly check of either 100 dollars or a
          custom amount of your choosing.
        </li>
        <li>
          The aim is to gain as much money in 365 days. Go big as much possible before
          the time is up or you stop the program!
        </li>
        <li>Only use integers to submit values for simplicity.</li>
        <li>If you ever need to access this page again, there will be a button in the top left corner in the game. However, DO NOT RESET THE GAME PAGE OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PROGRESS!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Are you ready? Push the button if you are!</h2>
    <div class="center">
